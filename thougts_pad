11:05 AM: "added less-rails and twitter-bootstrap-rails to gem file, fired a bundle install"
11:06 AM: "do not remember full bootstrap:install command, googling"
11:07 AM: "okay, by using less, need 'less' as parameter for the command."
11:10 AM: "think, bootstrap install is done, didn't tested it yet :) last command was g bootstrap:layout --force (to override the application.erb)"
11:13 AM: "thought a while, fired this: 'rails generate scaffold Post subject:string content:text release_date:datetime tags:string user_id:integer published:boolean'"
11:14 AM: "do a migration"
11:14 AM: "takin a first look onto what is there"

11:17 AM: "proceed scaffolding"
11:19 AM: "god, I hate leaks of my english vocabulary, dict.leo-ing for some word"
11:20 AM: "okay, I am looking for the word 'permit'. For security reasons, I am going to disable all comments by default, and permitting sensefully blog posts each later"
11:23 AM: "thought a while, fired this: 'rails generate scaffold Comment content:text permitted:boolean user_id:integer author_name:string author_email:string -f'"
11:23 AM: "I will have to differ, wether comments come from a registered user, or an anonymous...later then"
11:25 AM: "Everything is no basicly migrated, beginning some modelling specifying"
11:27 AM: "The nooby step: has_many comments to post, comment belongs to post"
11:31 AM: "found information for what I am looking for: immigrant gem"
11:36 AM: "that's where you are losing time, in fact of leak of expirience: immigrant need foreigner gem, so stucked a bit :/"

03:07 PM: "back to netbook, let's do some candy for the moment"
03:08 PM: "rooted the main route to posts controller"
03:20 PM: "visited some blogs, getbootstrap.com and font-awesome for references. now it looks slighly more like a real blog...going on"
03:23 PM: "did some graphical enhancements, now adding commenting feature"
03:29 PM: "built some basic comment functionality, now going to test it. Improved appearence a bit, too"
03:31 PM: "a noobean mistake, no post_id at comments table...this just can't work"
03:32 PM: "would write now the rerst, but must go..upload, push and see ya again"
_________
01:55 PM: Now from Israel, a bit of holiday...trying to proceed. It's good, I've decided to write a thoughts pad...I know were I was :D
01:57 PM: Now really starting
01:58 PM: Had wrong project open. Now started the server, want to see what's there
02:00 PM: Comments are connected, but the show view of post must be prepared for now
02:07 PM: Prototype of comment form written, now testing
02:20 PM: Son wants some entertainment, but managed it to make a comment to be saved in database. But it's not associated yet.
02:25 PM: added hidden field with "post_id", doesn't work. Added attr_accessor :post_id to post.rb, testing...
02:30 PM: still not working...now going in with debugger
02:34 PM: strange...post_id is not passed to controller...rechecking, if it written in the form...should be...
02:35 PM: it's not...repairing...
02:36 PM: F****, it doesn't wish to work at all :/ back in debuggin
02:37 PM: it is filtering out the post_id...that means, I have no idea, HOW rails it wants to have....time for google
_________
03:00 PM: was googling, till grandma asked to go for a meal...there is no way of saing no! back to google
03:09 PM: There is no attr_accessible in rails 4...it is now some permitting stuff in the posts_controller
03:10 PM: That was it...now I want the comment controller to redirect to the post
03:20 PM: Redirection works...now must go
_________
08:37 PM: Have not much time, making only some styles
09:51 PM: It was like I've added strftime to the comment date, went away putting children into bed, and passed the params right one minute ago...it looks good :D...going on
10:06 PM: Added root_url link to logo, some more style enhancements
10:13 PM: Made a simple workaround to support newline-to-break functionality...now need to change the post form
10:20 PM: only little changes + github push...I am tired right now...will proceede :D
_________
10:49 PM: next day, lets see how far I come
10:56 PM: played a bit with strptime, to understand how ruby makes it
11:02 PM: ok, post form looks good. DateTime conversion works out of the box, like! made a prettier checkbox.
11:07 PM: putted on devise into running, having now a authentication system
11:20 PM: it is now needed, to be signed in, to create a new post
11:25 PM: beautified it to a simple "force_session" method, inhered from application controller
11:38 PM: rounded up force_session, to make it like I want. I have also tried to make the "confirmable" option, but it seems not to work as I excpet, yet. Will add a force_admin_session or something like this. Until yet, only authenticated users are able to post. Ready for today
11:48 PM: could not stop, preparing my server for a first deploy :)
11:49 PM: god damn it...its not "-no-rdoc -no-ri", it's "--no-rdoc...."
_________
10:46 AM: Deployment worked well, found a bug: "delete" is able for non signed in users...that's bad
11:03 AM: Generated devise components, marked up the login view, removed demo links, started to markup the sidebar
11:17 AM: Now fixed the issue with session + destroy...now closing all the features for signed in users
11:28 AM: I am not really fast ^__^. But I never said I am a rails contender, well...I don't like the back button...need breadcrumbs
11:37 AM: Added breadcrumbs, new column name "seo name"
11:49 AM: users own posts, seo urls supported, breadcrumb fixed
_________
07:38 PM: got a little window of time...now lets sort by time desc :)
08:13 PM: brought my son to bed, built in sorting, paging, correct paths, and a mark of what is published
08:25 PM: comments now also sorted, permission filter added
